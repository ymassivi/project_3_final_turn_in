    <h2>MY LIFE MOTIVATIONS</h2>
    <p>I have many posts that inspire me to stay on track and motivated</p>
    <p>Here are 3 that always make me think and get me to want to move to the next level</p>

    <p>We all go trough situations that we wish had never happened to us, but once a wise man said i quote:"you don't grow in good times"</p>

    <img src="media/pic2.png" alt="PIC2"/>
    <p>This is reminds me that no doing it, is being selfish because whatever we were meant to do is useless if we never act upon and as a result, the all world will never see that thing the only us were gifted with.</p>

    <p>This last one is favorite one, i used to be very reactive after being offended by a person but that changed after reading this.
    <p>A wise man once said, "whoever controls your emotion or reaction controls you"</p>
    <p>Hope you learned something by reading this.</p>
